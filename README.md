# Spatial Join using SQL

Welcome to the "Spatial Join SQL Queries on NYC Database" repository! This project contains a collection of SQL queries focused on performing spatial joins using geographical data from the New York City (NYC) database. The repository serves as a resource for those interested in spatial analysis and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) using SQL.

# Features
Spatial Joins: Demonstrates how to perform spatial joins between different datasets such as buildings, parks, and census tracts.

Geospatial Functions: Uses geospatial SQL functions like ST_Within, ST_Contains, ST_Intersects, and ST_Distance.

Data Aggregation: Aggregates spatial data based on geographical boundaries.

Data Filtering: Filters data using spatial criteria.

Visualization: Provides insights into how to visualize spatial data results.

# Dataset

The queries in this repository use publicly available datasets from the NYC Open Data portal and other sources. The data includes information about:

NYC buildings

Parks and recreational areas

Census tracts and demographic data

Public amenities like schools, hospitals, and libraries

Note: Ensure you have access to the necessary datasets and that they are loaded into your spatial database system, such as PostGIS, before running the queries.
